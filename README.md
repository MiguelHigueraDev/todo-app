# todo-app - Basic Todo App
A basic todo app that I made for [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-todo-list).

### Features:
- Create multiple categories
- Store todos in each category
- Set todo priorities
- See each todo's due date
- Mark todos as completed
- Uses localStorage to store data in the browser

### What I learned while doing this project:

- How to create classes and use their methods
- Static methods and fields
- JavaScript modules
- `pointer-events` CSS property (very useful to avoid event delegation)
- How to use localStorage (read and write)
- `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()`

### Build instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
3. `npm run start` to start development server.
4. `npm run build` to build for production.

`npm run build` will output to `/dist` directory.
